<!-- **Description:**   -->
- *Colors of Nobility* is a Roguelite deckbuilding turn-based RPG game, staged for official release in late 2024. Inspired by *Slay the Spire*'s mechanics, this game features cozy hand-drawn visuals and deep gameplay mechanics, along with a unique map system that provides a challenging experience.

I took lead on the game's overall engineering. I am responsible for entire infrastructures for the game's ever-expanding mechanics, as well as shipping the game on Steam platform. This game is made along with another colleague who specializes in art and game design.

<!-- **Description:**   -->
- I worked on Naver Z's mobile metaverse platform *ZEPETO*, where players enter thousands of user-created worlds with their custom-fit avatars. Along with other platform works, I was the main engineer for creating the *On the Way Home* world, where users can create and edit custom movies with their own character. This world was ranked among the top visited worlds and had an exceptional retention rate as a standalone gameplay world.

I took charge of the entire gameplay system and collaborated with artists and engineers to achieve top-notch visuals and gameplay.
