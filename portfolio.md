<!-- **Description:**   -->
*Colors of Nobility* is a Roguelite deckbuilding turn-based RPG game, staged for official release in late 2024. Inspired by *Slay the Spire*, this game features cozy hand-drawn visuals and deep gameplay mechanics, along with a unique map system that provides a challenging experience. I took lead on the game's engineering, along with another colleague who specializes in art and game design.

<!-- **Description:**   -->
I worked on Naver Z's mobile metaverse platform *ZEPETO*, where players enter thousands of user-created worlds with their custom-fit avatars. Along with other platform works, I was the main engineer for creating the ***On the Way Home*** world, where you can create a custom movie with your own character swapped in, scored exceptionally high visitor statistics and retention rate as a standalone gameplay world. I supervised the whole gameplay system and collaborated with artists and engineers to achieve the top-notch visuals and gameplay.

I worked on Big Huge Game's mobile strategy game *Dominations*, where you build your own base while attacking and pillaging resources from other players' bases, similar to Supercell's *Clash of Clans*. I was responsible for creating new gameplay features, in-app purchase logic, and refactoring 5+ years of legacy code.
